                        Hi, my name is Álvaro. I am currently studying at UCSD during my Junior year as an exchange student,
                        but I am originally from Spain, where I study at Carlos III. My major is Data Science and Engineering,
                        and I am also doing a minor in Finance and Accounting. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        My main interest is Data Science (Predictive Modeling, Computer Vision, Machine Learning...), but I 
                        also enjoy other fileds such as Business Analytics, or Quantitative Finance
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        During my first and second year of University,
                        I worked giving particular Python classes to other students.
                        Since November 2022, I also work as the Head of
                        Content of the Bussiness Analytics association in UC3M.
                    </p>

                <p>Theese are some of the projects where I have worked so far:</p>

                    </a>
                </div>
                <p>In the future the projects will be uploaded on my GitHub.</p>
                <p>
                    The first project is on how the Black-Scholes option valuation is asymptotically equivalent to using 
                    montecatlo simulation. I did this project last year while learning about derivatives. I think the visualization 
                    helps you to understand better option pricing models.
                    In the second project I used reinforcement learning to try to create an automatic agent in Pac-Man. The reinforcement 
                    learning technique used was used on the q values of the possitions with some created attributes like how far the nearest
                    ghost was ussing Manhattan distance, in what direction the nearest food was...
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third project consists in hand-written number classification using convolutional neural networks (CNN.
                    I did this project during this year at UCSD, and I also developed a tk to be able to write your own number to
                    use the trained model to classificate it. The last project is included in the portfolio to showcase the typical
                    visualization techniques that a data science project requires. The project consist in the selection of the 
                    variables in a linear regression depending on different criterias and the visualization of the results.
                </p>

                <p>I have many other interesting project that I decided to keep out of the Portfolio to not make it look very messy,
                   but if you are interested on some more sample projects, do not hesitate on reaching out!
